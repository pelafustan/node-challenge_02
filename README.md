# NodeJS and Express.js

## Challenge 2

### Context

We were asked to develop an API capable of add, edit and remove tracks from a setlist stored in a `json` file. 

#### Disclaimer

I found the `html` provided to perform this challenge deeply awful, so I took the liberty of making my own front for the backend.

#### Prerequisites

You need to have installed `nodemon` globally.

### How can I see this?

Well, first of all you need to have installed `node` before running anything. Also, you need to clone this repo.

Once you have cloned this repo, `cd` into it. Here, you'll find two folders: one for the frontend (`client`) and one for the backend (`server`). First, you need to start the server, then the front. To start the backend, you need to:

```
cd server && npm install && nodemon index.js localhost 8089
```

Once the backend is running, open a new terminal and `cd` into the `client` directory and then run
```
npm install && npm run dev
```

Now, you're ready to play with the app. Have fun!
